# ImprezGarage

Copyright of Nicholas Andrew Bull 2021

I wanted to build a tool that would showcase the skills I have developed over time through my work building tools at Rockstar and Ubisoft. I am also very into cars and really like to take care of mine, this is where ImprezGarage comes in as it meets both of my needs.

I have built ImprezGarage with C#, WPF, MVVM, Prism and Firebase, for the database. The requirements for this tool was to have a program where I can add my vehicle to and any important details i.e. road tax expiry date and insurance expiry date. I also wanted to be able to keep track of my petrol expenses as sometimes we can all spend a bit more than we planned on petrol, especially if you have a busy month. The last requirement was for me to be able to track when I have performed a maintenance check of the vehicle, which I try to do once a month (or at least thatâ€™s what I tell myself). Once I had these requirements I set off building ImprezGarage.

ImprezGarage is a vehicle maintenance tool designed to help keep track of when I have performed any checks on the vehicle i.e. an oil change. It will also remind you when you have not performed any maintenance checks in a period of time.

ImprezGarage has been built on the Prism framework, allowing for me to break up the application into loosely couple modules. This allows for each module to be maintained and tested more thoroughly as well as, allowing for modules to be added or removed at any point without causing an affect on the other parts of the application.
